### Country and representativeness
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Cnt_ir <- allines %>% 
  select(Country, Isrep) %>% 
  mutate(Isrep = recode(Isrep, `2` = "not representative", `1` = "representative")) %>% 
  drop_na()
```

The chi-squared test shows us that country and representativeness are associated $\chi^2(2, n=784)=9.40, p < .05$ Looking at the standardized residuals we can see that the biggest deviance (-2.28) comes from Estonian articles being unrepresentative a lot **less** than could be expected under independence of country and representativeness. The standardized residuals in Russia (1.33, -0.58)  and US (0.93, -0.41) seem to be pretty much similar with articles in both countries being unrepresentative slightly more times than could be expected but not smuch more. Russias and US contribution to the chi-squared statistic is small and most of the deviance from independence seems to come from Estonia.
```{r echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
CrossTable(Cnt_ir$Country, Cnt_ir$Isrep, chisq = TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid = TRUE, format = "SPSS")
```

```{r echo = FALSE}
mosaicplot(table(Cnt_ir$Country, Cnt_ir$Isrep), shade = TRUE, las=2,
           main = "Article representativeness", xlab = "Country", ylab = "Representativeness"
           )
```

### Framing of Issues in the countries

162 articles, that is 162/800 = 20.25% are articles with multiple "issues" and/or multiple "frames". Since here the object of study is "the article" and not the variable or coding itself, multiple codings will be reduced to a single "main code" for each article for the sake of the independence requirement (between the categories) of our analysis. Further research could be done to investigate the multiple codings themselves. For example the relationship between issues within articles and wether some issues (or) are more likely to be together than others.

We consolidated issues a, c, f, i, k into the category "Other", 8 articles were excluded because in 4 cases framing was "unclear" and in 4 cases issue was not coded.
```{r echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
Cnt_fr_is <- allines %>%
  mutate(id = row_number()) %>% #Lisan igale artiklile unique id
  select(id, Country, Frame_code, Issue) %>% # vajalikud tulbad
  separate(Frame_code, c("Frame1", "Frame2", "Frame3")) %>% # lahutan mitme kodeeringuga erinevateks tulpadeks
  select(id, Country, Frame1, Issue) %>% 
  mutate(Frame1 = recode(Frame1, i="d")) %>% 
  filter(Frame1 != c("Unclear")) %>% #Neid ei taha
    separate(Issue, c("Issue1", "Issue2", "Issue3", "Issue4")) %>% #Sama, mis frame'idega issuede jaoks
    select(id, Country, Frame1, Issue1) %>% 
    mutate(Issue1 = recode(Issue1, D = "d")) %>% # D on tegelt d
  mutate(Issue1 = recode(Issue1, a = "Other", c = "Other", f = "Other", i = "Other", k = "Other", I = "Other")) %>%
    drop_na() %>% #Kõik na-d maha (tekkisid sellepärast, et erinev arv kodeeringuid artiklitel)
  rename(Frame = Frame1, Issue = Issue1)
```

```{r echo = FALSE, message = FALSE, fig.dim= c(12,10)}
Cnt_fr_is %>% 
  group_by(Country, Issue, Frame) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  mutate(Frame = recode(Frame, a = "Attribution of responsibility", b = "Conflict", c = "Economic",
                        d = "Human interest", e = "Morality")) %>% 
  mutate(Issue = recode(Issue, b = "Issue: Local Elections/politics", d = "Issue: Ukraine", e = "Issue: Social Welfare",
                      g = "Issue: Military", h = "Issue: Public Health and Safety", j = "Issue: International Relations")) %>%
  ungroup() %>% 
  group_by(Country, Issue) %>% 
  mutate(pct = paste0("(",round((n/sum(n))*100,0),"%)*")) %>% 
  ggplot(., aes(x = Country, y = n)) + 
  ggtitle("Framing of issues in Estonia, Russia, and the US") +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")+
  geom_bar(aes(fill = Frame), stat = "identity", position = "dodge", width = 0.8) +
  geom_text(aes(x = Country, y = n, label = paste0(n, "\n", pct), group = Frame), 
            position = position_dodge(width = 0.9), vjust = -0.5, size = 2)+
  expand_limits(y = c(0, 30))+
  annotate("text", x = 1.3, y = 30, label = "*% of issue in country", size = 2.5, color = "red")+
  facet_wrap(~ Issue) +
  ggsave("cnt_fr_is_bars.png", dpi= 350)
```

A chi-squared test ignoring issues shows us that **Country and Framing are not associated** with $\chi^2(8, n=629)=11.208, p = .19$. That suggests that Framing is independent of the country where the news are published. Looking at the standardized residuals we see that most of them are between 2 and -2 with only the framing "Human Interest" in Estonia showing a standardized residual greater than 2 at 2.04 and with that deviating the most from what could be expected under independence. That is still barely two standard deviations and cant be considered a strong enough evidence to say at the .05 alfa level that country and framing are related.
```{r echo = FALSE}
Cnt_fr <- Cnt_fr_is %>% 
  select(id, Country, Frame)
chisq.test(Cnt_fr$Country, Cnt_fr$Frame)

mosaicplot(table(Cnt_fr$Country, Cnt_fr$Frame), shade = TRUE, las=2,
           main = "Relationship of framing with country", xlab = "Country", ylab = "Frame"
           )
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CrossTable(Cnt_fr$Country, Cnt_fr$Frame, chisq = TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid = TRUE, format = "SPSS")
```

Looking at the relationship between issue and framing (ignoring country alltogether) we can se a strong relationship $\chi^2(20, n=629)=95.45, p < .001$. As expected framing and issue are strongly related. Looking at the standardized residuals we can see that "Local Eelctions/Politics" is framed much less as "economic" than would be expected under independence; also that "Social welfare" is framed as "conflict" much less and much more as "Economic" (that also being the biggest contributor to the chi squared statistic) than would be expected if issue and frame had no relationship. Also that Public health and safety issue is framed considerably more as "Human Interest" than would be expected under independence.
```{r echo = FALSE}
Is_fr <- Cnt_fr_is %>% 
  select(id, Issue, Frame)

chisq.test(Is_fr$Issue, Is_fr$Frame)

mosaicplot(table(Is_fr$Issue, Is_fr$Frame), shade = TRUE, las=2,
           main = "Relationship of framing with Issue", xlab = "Issue", ylab = "Frame"
           )
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
CrossTable(Is_fr$Issue, Is_fr$Frame, chisq = TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid = TRUE, format = "SPSS")
```

Looking at the relationship between country and Issue (ignoring framing) we can see that country and issue are very strongy related at $\chi^2(10, n=629)=172.9, p < .001$. Telling us that Issues reported are dependent on the country. Looking at the standardized residuals we can see that in each country there are issues that get reported less or more than could be expected when issue would have no relationship with country. We can see that in Estonia issues b and e are reported more than expected and issues d and j get reported less then epected. In russia issue d gets reported more than expected and issue b gets reported significantly less. In the US issues d and e are reported a lot less than expected and j is reported more. We can see that issues reported in different countries differ a lot. And all the countries are very different in what issues they report more or less than would be expected under independence. There is no apparent similarity between any two countries.
```{r echo = FALSE}
Cnt_is <- Cnt_fr_is %>% 
  select(id, Country, Issue)

chisq.test(Cnt_is$Country, Cnt_is$Issue)

mosaicplot(table(Cnt_is$Country, Cnt_is$Issue), shade = TRUE, las=2,
           main = "Relationship of Issue with country", xlab = "Country", ylab = "Issue"
           )
```

```{r eval = FALSE, echo =FALSE}
CrossTable(Cnt_is$Country, Cnt_is$Issue, chisq = TRUE, expected = TRUE, sresid = TRUE, format = "SPSS")
```

Moving on we will look at conditional independence to see if the relatsionhip between two variables changes when keeping the third variable at some constant level. To do a general test of the significance of that relationship we will build a log-linear model and asess the likelihood ratio of the two models after removing different two way interactions from on of the models. The results show that removing the frame and country interaction from the model, the model fit does not change significantly from a model with all possible two way interactions $\chi^2(8)=-11.288, p = 0.1859$. That tells us that generally 

we can see that Essentially meaning that given an issue and telling me how it is framed i can not generally say which country we are talking about. That is the case generally and is different on certain issues.. On the other hand the dependence of Issue and Frame remains even conditioned on country. That means looking at countries separately Issues and Frames remain associated. More work needs to be done to verify these reuslts....
